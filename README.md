## 📜 About
I am a B.Tech Computer Science student documenting my journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms** in Python. My goal is to build the discipline required to crack technical internships and create a strong foundation for my future specialization in AI/ML.

This repository serves as my **"Training Arc"** — a daily log of my code, optimizations, and complexity analysis.

## 🚀 How I Solve Problems
To ensure I am actually learning and not just memorizing, I follow this framework:

1.  **Understand:** Read the constraints and edge cases.
2.  **Visualize:** Draw the data structure on paper.
3.  **Brute Force:** Solve it first (even if it's slow).
4.  **Optimize:** Can I use a Hash Map? Two Pointers? (Cut down O(n²) → O(n)).
5.  **Code:** Write clean, Pythonic code.

## 📂 Repository Structure
I organize my code by **Pattern/Topic** to focus on the underlying logic rather than just the question name.
