## 📜 About
I am a B.Tech Computer Science student documenting my journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms** in Python. My goal is to build the discipline required to crack technical internships and create a strong foundation for my future specialization in AI/ML.

This repository serves as my **"Training Arc"** — a daily log of my code, optimizations, and complexity analysis.

## 📂 Repository Structure
I organize my code by **Pattern/Topic** to focus on the underlying logic rather than just the question name.
